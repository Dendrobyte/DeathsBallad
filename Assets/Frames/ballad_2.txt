DEATH: This shit really was easier when I could escort souls independently, now I’m just stuck with so much at once…
PLAYER: Wait, I don’t just get peace and quiet?
DEATH: Peace and quiet around here? Please. I can’t remember the last time I couldn’t hear a murmuring of souls. If you want quiet, ya gotta cross here, kid.
PLAYER: What so you got like a boat or something?
DEATH: Ah perfect, you take over a little bit! [Hands player the scythe, becomes a small Death] Doesn’t end up being a “killing Death” thing, but idk that’s alright for now.
