DEATH: Welcome to the world of the dead, kid!
PLAYER: What so you just… sit here… doing nothing?
DEATH: As in life, comes death! Sit around at your desk all day, sitting and fishing all day. Hell, pushing a boulder all day might just be the same thing if you look at it. I fished Camus out of here and boy did he talk my ear off.
PLAYER: Can’t you just float me across? I really have to fish souls for you?
DEATH: Something like that. You do a little work for me, I do a little work for you.
